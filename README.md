# Classic Snake Game in Java
This repository implements a classic Snake game written in Java. Play by controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding hitting the walls or your own body.

## Features

1. Grid-based movement with smooth animation
2. Food spawns randomly on the board
3. Scorekeeping based on the length of the snake
4. Game Over detection for collisions with walls or the snake's body


## Getting Started

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Ensure you have Java installed (version 8 or higher recommended).
- Run the App.java class to start the game.

## Controls:
  Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.

## Challenge Yourself:
Try to beat your high score!

## This project is a great starting point for learning about:
  - Java programming fundamentals (variables, loops, conditional statements)
  - Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects)
  - Working with graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Java using Swing
